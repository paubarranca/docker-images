Custom Docker Images 
=============

This repository contains Dockerfiles to create custom images and the resources that i use to create them, including scripts, config files... 

All the images are available in Docker Hub at [paubarranca](https://hub.docker.com/?namespace=paubarranca), feel free to use them ;)

Please use a tagged image that works for you as v1, v2... DO NOT USE the latest tag in any of the images!
