This repository contains Dockerfiles and different resources to create custom containers images, including the base code, scripts, config files... and the Dockerfiles.

The builded content will be available in Docker Hub at https://hub.docker.com/search?q=paubarranca&type=image, feel free to use whatever you want ;)

Please use a tagged image that works for you as v1, v2... DO NOT USE the latest tag in any of the images!
